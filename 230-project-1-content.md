# Wacky Waffle
## High Concept
Click the waffle. Buy upgrades to increase your waffle production. Expand your empire and become the most powerful baker in the world!
## Genre
Incremental game that begins with the player clicking waffle, then buying upgrades to click the waffle less. There is no definite ending, and the genre slowly changes to an idle game after progressing through the main story and content. You could also say it is a simulation game in an abstract sense, that you are a baker expanding your empire. You could even go as far to say it’s a roleplaying game at that point, it all depends what you want to believe when you play.
## Platform
The game will be accessible through all platforms that can access the internet. Since most of the gameplay involves simple button clicking and interactions, the page design can easily be designed to suit almost all screen sizes.
## Story
You start your adventure as a humble Belgian waffle baker, working in your dingy, cramped home kitchen. Your dream is to become the world’s greatest waffle baker, and each time the waffle is clicked, another waffle is baked. After gaining some capital, you can expand your operation by hiring employees and purchasing more equipment, and eventually, take over the entire waffle industry.  The beginning determination to solidify your waffle company’s success will be replaced by with the drive to take over the world as you become more and more powerful through your corporation. The themes throughout the early game will be lighthearted and positive, but as the game progresses the themes get more dark until the game becomes more akin to an eldritch horror like experience.
## Esthetic
The style of graphics in the game and menus will have a cartoony and stylized appearance, with the colors being light and calm early game, and becoming darker and more unsettling as the waffle production increases. Visual elements will also become more disturbing as the player progresses, and by the end will be quite different than the innocent icons and graphics at the start. Sound in the game will be minimal, and won’t include any traditional score or backing music, but sound effects will be used when sparingly. Clicking the waffle and menu buttons, as well as notification popups and other significant events, will all have appropriate sound effects accompanying them. Then, as the tone shifts late game, ambient sound effects will occasionally play to support the other emerging themes and make the game more unsettling.
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The first minute or so of this game will be boring, the player will be clicking the waffle and that’s it. Even then, behavioral momentum will compel players to keep clicking until they can progress, which won’t be long. Once the player starts upgrading their waffle production through various means, other mechanics begin to influence gameplay. Achievement becomes an integral aspect of almost all aspects of progression, through achievements earned after certain milestones, every upgrade bought or increase in waffle production, and with every advancement in content or story. Eventually, blissful productivity will take effect once the player becomes invested enough in their playthrough, with players finding reward in expanding their waffle empire and increasing their power. Buying upgrades also allows players a choice of playstyle, active or passive, either clicking often or treating it more like an idle game.
### Control
Since gameplay consists only of clicking things on screen, controls can work on almost all devices. For desktops and computers, the mouse would be used to interact, and for mobile devices or tablets, touch could be used in place of a mouse.
### New User Experience
The simplicity of the game mechanics makes it easy for new players to pick up all the elements of play, but instructions will still be given. The same area of the screen used to display story and progress notifications will also tell players how to start increasing their waffle production when the game begins. Even in the event of a player accidentally skipping or missing the tutorial popups, the display and controls, as well as the text labeling different elements, make it straightforward how to increase one’s waffle production.
### Player Learning
Without an ending, what the player needs to learn when starting to play, is all the player has to understand to experience everything the game has to offer. Even if you consider earning all the achievements in the game an “end”, a player who clicks the waffle for the first time has all the skills he needs to reach that point eventually. As for as strategies and mechanics go, there is not much depth, and players upgrade, wait, then upgrade more, until the next “goal” is reached, which is an essential aspect of the game that can be learned very early on.
